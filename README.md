## About

This analysis attempted determine the most important features when predicting a yearly salary of more than 50,000 USD. A logistic regression model and AdaBoost model were trained in an effort to extract feature importance. The models did not perform exceedingly well, with scores in the low 80s, but performed similarly to random forest and support vector machine (SVM) models. The logistic regression modelâ€™s most important features in predicting a yearly salary of greater than 50,000 USD were `marital_status_Married-AF-spouse` and `marital_status_Married-civ-spouse` while the most important features in predicting a yearly salary of less than 50,000 USD were `occupation-private-house-serv` and `workclass-without-pay`. The Adaboost model identified `education-num` and `age` as the most important features in classification.

The data used in this project was created by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker, Data Mining and Visualization division at Silicon Graphics. This data was extracted from 1994 US Census Data. It was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Dua and Graff 2017) and can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult). Each row in the data represents the attributes of an individual such as: age, education level, race, working hours, etc. The target variable is whether one's income is above or below 50K.
